# App Launcher

An offline-first Electron library for applications, folders, files, URLs and named workspaces.

## Run and package

```bash
npm install
npm run desktop:start
```

Create a Windows installer with:

```bash
npm run desktop:build
```

The installer is written to `dist-desktop/`.

## What this release changes

- Existing `localhost` launcher data is migrated once into a local v2 library file, with a browser-storage backup retained.
- Each item has a primary purpose and can belong to additional groups.
- Groups and tags are displayed alphabetically; the library supports flat, purpose and A–Z views.
- The dashboard panels can be collapsed, hidden and restored.
- Workspaces combine applications with actual folders, files, URLs and protocol links.
- Folder scanning uses actual local paths, and matching targets are not imported twice.
- The Electron bridge handles local opening, scanning, persistence and icon caching; the renderer does not have direct Node access.

## Development checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
```
